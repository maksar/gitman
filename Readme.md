## Install

Telegram uses `@BotFather` bot to create and manage bots. `@itransition_gitman_bot` was created by such dialog:

    You:
        /newbot

    BotFather:
        Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.

    You:
        Gitman

    BotFather:
        Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.

    You:
        itransition_gitman_bot

    BotFather:
        Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/itransition_gitman_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

    You:
        @itransition_gitman_bot

    BotFather:
        OK. Send me a list of commands for your bot. Please use this format:

        command1 - Description
        command2 - Another description

    You:
        create - Creates Bitbucket repository or changes itâ€™s settings.
        close - Closes Bitbucket project or repository.
        reopen - Re-opens Bitbucket project or repository.
        cancel - Cancels current command.

    BotFather:
        Success! Command list updated. /help

## Authentication

`config/users.yml` file contains list of allowed users in a format `Lastname, Firstname`.
Bot will ask to send user's contact. Then it will check ActiveDirectory for user's fist and last name, phone number and uid (in `extensionAttribute9` field).
If everything matches, bot will store user in `config/users.yml` file and start talking to him.
